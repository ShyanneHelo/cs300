What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I was sloving in my projects for this course was creating different kinds of data structures to find the best data structure for the advising application. 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I apporached the problem by creating multiple different data strtuctures. Data structures are important because they allow us to organize and store data. It is also important to understand data structures to ensure you are desiging an effiecent algorithm.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks when working on my project I would look up the error codes that I was getting and ways to reslove the error codes. I would also find useful videos to watch on coding in C++. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by understanding how to interpert and produce a program successfully. It also expanded my approach on creating algorithms.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project has evolved the way I write programs by helping me understand strings and how to accurately type them to make the code readable. It has also helped me evolve by creating Pseudocode to have the code more organized and readable.
